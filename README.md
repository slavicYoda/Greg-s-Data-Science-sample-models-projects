This is a repository set up to share some of my Data Science models and projects that I have been working  on while working at RS Components.
Please keep in mind that I'm not able to share full-fledged, productionalized models as my contract prevents me from doing so.
Thus I'm sharing models/projects that were actioned and ultimately served as basis for production-ready models but might not be finished products.
I lead Data Science and Intelligent Automation capability for the group, while holding the role of Head of Machine Learning, Automation & Technology Platforms at RS.

If you have questions, hit me up.

Cheers,
Greg Lee-Podgorski
